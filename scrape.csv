A celebration of Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and — above all — Love, Moulin Rouge! is more than a musical — it is a state of mind.Set in Montmartre Quarter of Paris, France, at the turn of the century, a world of indulgent beauty and unparalleled extravagance, of Bohemians and aristocrats, of boulevardiers and mademoiselles, Moulin Rouge! The Musical tells the fictional story of an ambitious, lovesick writer, Christian, and a dazzling, entrancing chanteuse, Satine. Their lives collide at the Moulin Rouge with its many characters, including the host Harold Zidler, the brilliant and starving artist Toulouse-Lautrec, the greatest tango dancer–and gigolo–in all of Paris, Santiago; the tempting Nini; and The Duke of Monroth, the wealthy and entitled patron of the club who thinks he can buy anything he wants...including love.Playbill will receive a commission if you purchase a ticket via the buttons on this page.SCHEDULE:January 28–February 2: Tuesday @7pm, Wednesday @2pm and 8pm, Thursday @7pm, Friday @7pm, Saturday @2pm and 8pm, Sunday @3pm     ",Al Hirschfeld Theatre,"302 W. 45th St., New York, NY",full/2019_Moulin_Rouge!_The_Musical.png
